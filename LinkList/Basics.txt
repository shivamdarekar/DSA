- in linklist element/char/double cannot store in contigious location they store anyware
  but in array or string they are contigious 
- also size of linklist is increase or decrease at any moment

- We use Linked List over Array when we need dynamic size and frequent insertions or deletions without shifting elements.

- Linked lists use heap memory because their size is dynamic and nodes must persist beyond function calls, 
  which is not possible with stack memory.

-Heap memory ek runtime memory area hai jahan:
   1. Objects dynamically allocate hote hain
   2. Size compile time pe fixed nahi hota
   3. Memory program ke run time par milti hai
   4. Java me almost sab objects heap me bante hain(linklist)

- Linked list me:
    - Nodes ek function me bante hain
    - Dusre function me access hote hain
    - Program ke end tak survive karte hain
    - Ye sirf heap memory me possible hai

- Garbage Collection = Java ka automatic memory cleaner
- Jo objects:
   1.Ab use nahi ho rahe
   2.Jin tak koi reference nahi pahunch raha
   3.Java unko automatically delete kar deta hai
- Garbage collection is the automatic process in Java that reclaims heap memory by removing objects that are no longer reachable.

- when get a problem which involves creations of new LL then use concept of dummy node

- at every timr firstly think abt the extreme solution then move ahed
